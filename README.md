1. Project Overview

This document provides a comprehensive guide for building a highly available, scalable, and secure forex trading platform using Kubernetes, GitLab, Argo CD, and various open-source tools. It includes infrastructure setup, deployment, testing, and disaster recovery strategies.

2. Infrastructure Setup

2.1. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

2.1.1. Terraform Configuration

1. Create a Terraform Configuration (main.tf):

provider "aws" {
  region = var.aws_region
}

resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
  cidr_block = var.vpc_cidr
}

resource "aws_subnet" "subnet" {
  vpc_id     = aws_vpc.main.id
  cidr_block = var.subnet_cidr
}

resource "aws_eks_cluster" "cluster" {
  name     = var.cluster_name
  role_arn  = aws_iam_role.eks.arn
  version   = "1.21"
  vpc_config {
    subnet_ids = aws_subnet.subnet.*.id
  }
}

output "cluster_name" {
  value = aws_eks_cluster.cluster.name
}


2. Variables Configuration (variables.tf):

variable "aws_region" {
  default = "us-west-2"
